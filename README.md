## nvim

My configurations for neovim (at least version 0.7), neovide, neovim-qt files.

* Based on lua.
* Mostly a port from my original vimscript.
* Original Lua configuration ideas taken from
  [Neovim-from-scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch)
* The current configuration has diverged significantly from the setup in
  Neovim-from-scratch, with tons of custom functions.
